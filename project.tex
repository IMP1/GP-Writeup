\section{Motivation}
%TODO ~ADD: some references for this stuff. I have them, just chuck in citations to papers I already got.
GP is a graph programming language. It was developed to provide a language that is expressive enough to solve complex graph problems, while also having a simple enough syntax to allow for formal reasoning. Graphs and graph transformations have previously implemented in low-level languages, like C. This meant that it was more difficult to understand, verify, and implement \cite{gp_lang}. GP at its core has four commands that nevertheless allows every computable function on graphs to be implemented \cite{gp1}. These commands are a single application of a rule, sequential composition, loops, and branching. Loops are implemented in a run-for-as-long-as-possible style.

GP2, the second iteration of GP, builds upon the first. It adds a few new features, and some syntactic sugar \cite{gp2_design}. Also, the design of GP2 was slightly modified to enable a higher level of performance. A compiler was produced by the University of York for GP2. The compiler generates C code from a high level representation of a graph program in GP2. This has the advantage of being able to reason about graphs and graph programming using GP2, but allows for the low-level, high-performance that C allows for.

The University of York has also produced a graphical editor for creating graphs and graph programs. The editor depends on the compiler to execute a given graph program on the host graph, thereby producing the resultant graph. It displays the graphs, and has a graphical user interface for creating graphs, rules and graph programs.

Currently, the compiler generates the code to run the entire graph program on the given host graph. It generates code for each rule and a main graph program file which makes use of the rules' code. After compilation, the C code implementation of the graph program can be run on the graph, and the resultant graph is saved in the given output directory.

If the graphical editor is being used, the user can graphically create the host graph, and the rules for the graph program within it, and can run their program on their host graph, and the editor will show them the resultant graph.

The aim of this project is to show the execution of the program, that is, the intermediate steps that result in the final output graph. This will allow users to see the process, which enables the correctness of the program to be ensured. It will also give people using these tools, who may not have a complete understanding of how graph programs work in general, or who aren't sure about their specific program's execution in particular, the opportunity to see the process with a finer granularity.

This tracing of graph programs will sit atop the existing GP2 implementation and be completely optional for any users. It will allow for deeper and more powerful visualisations of graph programs and their execution.

\section{Graph Programming}

\subsection{Graph Transformations}
A graph is a visual way of representing data and relationships. The formal definition is a set of vertices (nodes) \emph{V}, a set of edges \emph{E}, and a set of labels \emph{L}. Additionally \emph{source} and \emph{target} functions associate edges with nodes, and a \emph{label} function, which assigns labels to edges and nodes.
Graph theory is said to go back as far as the 1730s, with The K{\"o}nigsberg Bridge problem being regarded as the topic for the first paper on graph theory ever written \cite{grathe_origin}. 

The mathematical theory of Graph Transformation allows the transformation of graphs by way of rules. Rules are applied to graphs. They include a LHS (Left-Hand Side) graph, and RHS (Right-Hand Side) graph and an interface graph, which connects nodes in the LHS to nodes in the RHS. There is a convention that if the interface graph is ommited then it is inferred that it comprises the common labelled nodes in both the LHS and RHS.

Rules can either use a single-pushout or a double-pushout approach. In GP, graph transformations use the double-pushout with relabelling \cite[p. 100]{gp1}. Matches of rules must be injective morphisms and are only vaild if they don't result in \emph{dangling edges}, that is, edges with one or more ends not attactched to a node. The interface graph of a rule may be partially labelled, but all other graphs must be totally labelled. A partially labelled graph is %TODO definition of partially labelled graphs
, whereas a totally labelled graph is %TODO definiton of totally labelled graph

Figure \ref{fig:simple_rule} shows a simple rule that, given a non-empty host graph, creates a transitive graph, where every node with a directed path to another has a direct edge going to it. A directed path between two nodes \emph{A} and \emph{B} exists either if there is an outgoing edge from \emph{A} to \emph{B}, or for any of the nodes that have an incoming edge from \emph{A}, there is a directed path from it to \emph{B}.
Figure \ref{fig:simple_rule_sans_k} shows the same rule without its interface graph.

\subsection{Graph Programs}
The University of York has developed a graph programming language \emph{"GP1"} \cite{gp1}, and has developed a new implementation \emph{"GP2"}. The goal of both of these has been to write programs that manipulate graphs in terms of the graphs, rather than in general purpose languages like C or Java. 

Graph programming (GP) allows the application of programs to graphs. A program is made up of rules and rudimentary control structures, such as conditions, and loops. The rules are executed non-deterministically on a graph, known as the \emph{host graph}. The resulting graph is known as the \emph{result graph}. A simple program could just be the continued application of a single rule.

The program \ref{fig:simple_program} finds the shortest path to each node, using Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. Running it on the host graph will give the intermediary graphs shown in \ref{fig:simple_program_example}.

%TODO ~AMMEND: Use the ammended program to recreated the process. Also, add some more steps.
\input{simple_program_execution}

\section{GP2 Compiler}
Instead of using an abstract machine as GP1 did, the GP2 compiler generates C code directly \cite{chris_compiler}, which removes the reliance on specific abstract machine compilers and data formats for graphs and graph programs. It means that any C compiler can be used to generate the program code. It also attempts to standardise and document the format of graphs and programs that it takes. This means that tools to generate graphs either graphically or programmatically can be created without reducing modularity or creating complexity and interdependance between the components of the system \cite{gp2_ide}.

GP2 adds to GP the marking of nodes with a colour, or a special 'any' colour; additional conditions that can be checked against in a rule's schema, including the in-degree and out-degree of an edge, and whether there exists an edge between two nodes; and an additional branching mechanism: a try-then-else. In try-then-else and if-then-else branching, the condition is a set of rules schemata, and almost always alters the graph. If-then-else branching uses the graph before the 'if' condition is evaluated, and any changes are made, in the 'then' branch. In contrast, the try-then-else uses the \emph{result} of the 'try' condition in the 'then' branch. In both, the 'else' branch uses the graph before the condition is checked against \cite{gp2_design}.

GP2 no longer enforces non-deterministic execution \cite[p. 15]{gp2_ide}, and doesn't backtrack to reach all possible solutions. This was done to achieve a higher level of implementation efficiency \cite[p. 15]{chris_compiler}, but sacrifices completeness. Backtracking is still employed, but only in if and try statements and in loop bodies, but GP2 doesn't ensure that all possible results of a graph program on a host graph are returned \cite[p. 65]{chris_compiler}.

%TODO ~ADD: what GP2 adds (page 1 on https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/plasma/publications/pdf/Plump.WRS.11.pdf (gp2_design))

The GP2 compiler parses the program and host graph files, and generates a C code representation of the program, which can then be run. It generates an abstract syntax tree for the program, and creates files for each rule, with methods for matching, and methods for applying. 

%TODO ~ADD: more detailed explanation of how the GP2 compiler works.

\section{GP2 Editor}
The GP2 graphical editor for creating graphs and graph programs is currently under development. It will allow for the creation of graphs graphically, rather than textually, and it will allow for the creation of programs textually, and their rules graphically, assigning the LHS and RHS of the rules. In contrast with the GP1 editor, the GP2 editor will also include functionality to display nodes and edges in accordance with their marks.
% It has a tab for creating programs, which includes a rudimentary text editor.
% It has a tab for creating rules.
% It has a tab for creating graphs.
% It has a tab for running programs on graphs.
%TODO ~CHECK: the above statements.

%TODO ~ADD: a screenshot
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{editor_graph}

%TODO ~MENTION: that the editor has added positions to nodes in the lexer, and the parser ignores them.

\section{Program Tracing}
There are several techniques available to software developers when attempting to track down the locations of errors they've made. This process is called debugging, and many of the techniques involve outputting information about the program and its state throughout its execution. Other techniques involve dumping the last-stable memory at the point of a program crashing, which will then be analysed. 

\subsection{Tracing}
Tracing through the steps of a program has been around since programs themselves. The BASIC programming language had a command \emph{TRON}, short for TRace ON, which print the line numbers of each command as the program ran. 
Tracing allows programmers to ensure that each step is procuding the right results and allows a more detailed insight into the workings of a program. This is done by logging information about the execution of a program that will be useful for debugging or diagnostics, formal methods of which have been discussed as far back as the 70s \cite{psych_debug, code_walkthroughs}.

Although tracing, when as simple as possible, can be merely the addition of a few print statements, when applied throughout a program as a debugging tool, because tracing is generally such a low-level process, there's potential for a vast amount of logging messages \cite{}, which can impact performance. Usually programs have either run-time or compile-time options for turning off debugging to combat this. %TODO ~FIND: a paper or reference for the empty citation.

The trace is also usually only seen by the developer of a system, and so there is no need to have the messages be readable by, or understandable to, the users. This means it can be cheap to implement. However, due to the fact that tracing is a cross-cutting concern \cite{}, meaning that is is involved all throughout the program, it's difficult to decouple and modularise. %TODO ~FIND: a paper or reference for the empty citation.

The points within the program where information is divulged are referred to as tracepoints. They are hooking mechanisms which allow for tracing with little overhead when disabled, but that can be enabled at run-time and will provide static tracing \cite{tracing_book}.

\subsection{Breakpoints}
Breakpoints allow for the stopping or pausing of a program part of the way through its execution. This is done to allow usually to obtain knowledge about the state of the program at certain points throughout the process. \emph{Instruction Breakpoints} interrupt the program before an instruction is executed, but there are also \emph{Conditional Breakpoints}, or \emph{Watchpoints}, which trigger upon events such as reading from, or writing to, specific memory locations, or upon certain keystrokes.

\section{Users \& Requirements}
% ~2000 words (Problem analysis)
% ~3333 words (between Design *and* Implementation)

The users of GP2 as it stands are predominantly students and staff at the University of York, and researchers in the field of graph transformations. The students use it to get a hands-on appreciation of both graph transformation generally, and GP2 specifically. The key quality attributes regarding all users will be usability. The tracing of GP2 should serve to increase usability. 

Another stakeholder in the system that isn't a user is future developers, adding to, and maintaing, the software. The quality attributes that are most relevant to these stakeholders are maintainability and integratability. Therefore any additions made must keep these factors in mind.

Any tracing will need to not have any negative impacts on the currently existing system. Ideally, as little effect on efficiency and performace as possible should be made to the compiler, and to the generated code running the Graph Program. And as little effect on usability should be made with regards to the editor. The new system should also be completely backwards compatible. That is, the tracing should be optional, with the current implementation for running a given graph program on a host graph still performing that action.

Also, any changes made to the editor should serve only to enhance the user's understanding of the underlying process, and should be avoidable if they so choose.

It is critical to correctly identify the requirements for a system to be determined successful to allow for any evaluation. It also means that throughout the design process, there are key features to be kept in mind.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A program must be able to be stepped through, that is, a portion of the program (step) must be able to be run on either the host graph, or the resultant graph of a previous step's execution.
	\item These steps would ideally be of specifiable sizes.
	\item These steps must be able to be displayed graphically in the GP2 Editor.
	\item These steps would ideally be displayed in such a way to highlight any changes made in a step.
\end{enumerate}

\section{High-Level Design}
Writing maintainable code involves ensuring that the intent behind each procedure is as clear as possible to a programmer, familiar or unfamiliar with the system. This can be done with clear and useful naming of variables and functions, and with appropriate levels of comments documenting the intent behind the code.

A possible design that meets the first aims of this project would be to have the compiler generate "chunks" of the program. This would have shifted most of the extra processing into the compiler, and so would have had minimal impact on the running of the graph program. %TODO ~ADD: some other benefit of this? Chunks for steps allows for modularsation or isolation of certain steps?
However, this presents the problem that the compiler doesn't know the execution of the program at compile time, and so the sizes of these "chunks" cannot be determined. This means that the smallest size of chunk would have to be generated, and the runtime would determine how many of these correspond to a larger size of step. This also has the problem that the runtime needs to keep track of the current iteration of a loop, which is because the compiler doesn't know how many iterations of a loop will be run at compile time, so it cannot generate the program as a series of steps as it will be run. While this process doesn't have a significant impact on performance if the user is just performing a single step at a time, if the entire program is run, which is the default behaviour, there is a significant performance hit. If a large number of steps is needed to be run, then that requires the program to read in each chunk of code and execute it, for every step. Clever implementations could cache the loaded data, but this sort of file I/O is less costly if just performed once at the beginning.

This design also radically changes the structure of the existing compiler, and changes the flow of executing a graph program. For maintainability, the decision was made against changing the compiler in such a drastic a manner.

An alternative approach is to keep the compiler as it is, but to have it also generate breakpoints in the program code. These breakpoints would allow the program to end after a certain number of steps. Following this, program also needs to be able to start from a step other than the beginning so a user can step through more than once consecutively. This simpler design has less impact on the flow and structure of the compiler as it is, and should have very little impact on the runtime performance of the graph program if the user is executing the entire program. This is an improvement over the previous design in the case where the user is not stepping through the program at all. In the case where the user \emph{is} stepping through, the time taken to get the program state ready to perform the next step(s) is simply the time for a counter to reach the number n, where n is the last executed step. It doesn't need to perform any of the rule matches or applications, it's just traversing the runtime code's structure counting up to the current step. 

This approach obviously needs some way of keeping track of the last executed step, but it also has another problem to solve. Since GP is still non-deterministic, a method is needed to make sure the current step is correctly obtained. This method will need to ensure that each of the decisions chosen from rule sets and if- and try-statement branches is the same for each subsequent step through the program, until the program has terminated. This method could employ a lookup table of the decisions. This lookup table, along with the last executed step, could be stored in a small file alongside the output graph. Loading and saving to this file should have very little impact, and creating the lookup table when executing the graph program is also a simple process.

Since the smallest steps of any relevance to the user are the matching and applications of a rule, this could be the smallest size of step. However, since only the match step of the last rule being run matters at all to the user for the tracing, the decision to have a single rule application as the smallest step makes more sense. This doesn't solve the issue of the user being able to stop between a match and a step, but a simple flag to stop after a match, and before an application, of a rule would be a simple solution. However, this could be presented to a user as a step size for consistency.

A problem arises when the user has stepped through rule applications to the point where the current step is some part of the way through a procedure, and then specifies to step through a number of procedures. Since not all procedures are of the same length, running to "the same point" in subsequent procedures is meaningless, so either the first procedure step must be finishing the current procedure, or this must be done before procedure steps are begun to be counted. This can be generalised to all larger step sizes than have previously been run. The former choice, that of finishing the current step size as the first step of that size, makes sense when considering that running the program (the largest possible step size) from some way through the program, would obviously not finish the 'program' step and then run the program again.

Once stepping through the program is working, the resultant graph has to be saved somewhere for the editor to display it. This intermediate graph can either have its own file, or be saved as the output graph of the program. Having its own file may allow for further applications beyond this project, but being saved in the place of the resultant graph doesn't disrupt the existing flow of the overall system. The decision was made to use the latter, because it is a simple change for any future developer, and it has the least impact on the current system.

The last problem to solve is that of illustrating what changes have happened. It's possible a user is able to visually see new nodes and edges after a rule application, but in a large graph this may be more difficult. 

New nodes and edges are not the only changes that are to be "highlighted". Matched nodes and edges are also to be shown to the user, as well as relabelled nodes and edges. Removals cannot be shown as there is nothing to show, and nothing to attach a "highlight" to.

It's possible to have another file that would list each node and edge that has been added (or matched). This has the advantage of simplicity, but whereas the file containing the current step and branches is only accessed by the runtime code, any file containing the changes made in the last step would be accessed by the graphical editor, and potentially other applications further down the line. Therefore it seems more acceptable to have a more formal way to have this information be accessed. The idea of adding a specific label string for certain changes to a node's label was considered, but this would break functionality of GP2, as any conditions checking for a node's label to be empty would be invalidated by the existance of this 'change label'.

The current implementation of the GP2 Editor adds positions for nodes to the GP2 lexer. They are used by the editor to maintain structure of a graph and keep nodes in the same place where possible. They are used soley by the editor and the parser is instructed to ignore them. Since any "highlight" of a node is a similar type of information, that is, it pertains to not to the mathematical structure of the graph, but is useful in displaying it, it seems appropriate to use this approach for storing the changes of nodes.

\section{Design Breakdown}

Having identified key design problems and thought about preferred solutions, a breakdown of the proposed design is presented. There are certain things the compiler now needs to know in order to process tracing. The first of these is whether to do it at all. Given that the number of steps to perform and the size of those steps are to be passed to the program, the existence of these parameters are enough for the program to decide that it should perform tracing. These parameters also could require each other, as the size of the step is useless without how many of these steps are to be performed, and the number of steps is useless without knowing the size of the step. Alternatively there could be default values for these parameters. 

A default value for step size could either be a rule application, or a match/application of a rule, as these are the smallest step sizes. Any decision between these would be arbitrary and easy to change. A default value should be, for usability reasons, the value that is most often used. The tracing system being implemented here will use a rule application as its default step size, but ideally this would be reassessed when data of the size of steps users are most likely to run is obtained.

A default number of steps is less intuitive, as the program by default will run all the steps, however if tracing is being used by the user, perhaps a default value of a single step of the specified size could be used. 

The program needs no further information from the user to trace through steps, but requires information regarding the last executed step, if there was one. If not, then the program is simply starting the tracing from the beginning of the graph program, however if steps \emph{have} been made previously, we must begin the tracing from there. Also, if steps have been made previously, then rather than use the host graph, we need to use the graph outputted by the previous steps made. 

From this external information, the program can infer the ending point. If the ending point is not the end of the program as it would be without tracing, the current step is saved, as well as any non-deterministic choices that have been made up to the current step. Also upon reaching the ending point, if the program is performing tracing, it must highlight the changes that have occured during the last step.

Because the system can now stop its processing before the end of the graph program, it is wise to refactor out the process of finalisation. This will reduce code duplication, and will enhance maintainability. Finalisation includes garbage collection and saving the resultant graph. We can then add to this process the saving of the current step and non-deterministic choices, as well as the saving of highlights that have been made.

This leaves only the problem of highlighting changes that have been made. This is twofold and involved both detecting or recording that changes have been made, and saving this information somewhere the editor can access. The latter part of this problem is discussed in the high-level design: it will be saved alongside the graph, and highlights will be added to the lexer and parser, and ignored by the parser. The problem of detecting the changes that have been made is more challenging. This is because the compiler currently is the only part of the program that has certain information regarding a rule and this information is not avaialable at runtime. This information can be gathered in a less efficient manner by analysing the differences between the graph before the rule application, and the graph afterwards. However, with large graphs, this could potentially worsen performance. Alternatively, the compiler could be modifed to add this functionality to be available at runtime. This would give allow the runtime program to be more powerful, but would add complexity to both the runtime code and the compiler, possibley also impacting on performance.

\chapter{Implementation}
% ~3333 words (between Design *and* Implementation)

Before this project, the GP2 compiler took no command-line arguments. Now, however, it has certain parameters the user can pass. If the user passes the step flag '-s' they can pass one or both of the step size and the step count. The step size is case insensitive and can currently be a 'r' for a single rule, a 'm' for a match/application step of a rule, or a 'p' for a procedure. If no procedures other than the main declaration are defined, then 'p' will run the entire program. The step count is a positive integer which dictates the number of steps to run. If this number is high enough, however, the program will terminate normally when it has reached the end of the graph program.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:usage, caption=GP2 Usage]
Usage:\n
    GP2-run [-s <steps> [<step_size>]]
    GP2-run [-s <step_size> [<steps>]]
        -s : only runs a specified number of steps.
Step sizes:
    r : a single rule.
    m : a single match or application of a rule.
    p : a single procedure.
\end{lstlisting}

Implementing tracing can be broken into two main stages. The first is avoiding running rules we've applied in previous step executions, and the second is applying the number of steps specified. 

% Factor out the finalisation, as it can happen at other parts of the code now. Reference figure \ref{code:finalise} as the finalise method with additions of saving the current step.

%TODO ~MENTION: two steps.
	% first is getting up to date
	% second is running the step(s)
	
	
% Counter for each step size. 'Sgotta be, I reckon. Running a larger step size will set all the counters for the smaller step sizes to 0.

% With step_size being an enum, that's read in from the arguments (args can either be ints or strings, but are converted to the enum when they're read in, and with the smallest step (match/application) just setting a flag to true).

\section{Limiting the steps} %TODO ~AMMEND: change this title.

% The compiler currently generates code. It has methods for generating rule steps, and method for generating larger structures. I will add code at the end of these methods to see if the number of steps specified has been reached.
% This may be a lot of extra stuff in big graph programs with lots of rule, but it scales linearly with the number of rules which is good. Not crazy complex or overheady.

% A simple overview of the implementation is this:

% 1. Find the parts of the code that generate different sizes of step.
% 2. Implement breakpoints after each of them.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:breakpoint_1, caption=Pseudocode of breakpoints]
rule_step_application
if we_should_stop
    exit
endif
rule_step_application
if we_should_stop
    exit
endif
...
\end{lstlisting}

% This needs the addition of stopping *in* the rule_step_application (between match and apply)

% This will correctly end the program after X steps. However, running the program again will run the first steps again. So we need to start where we left off. So let's have the finalise code print the current_step to a file.
% The output_directory is given by the generating code and will the path to the same output directory where the resultant graph is stored.

%TODO ~ADD: The decisions made for non-deterministic choices aren't saved here. They should be saved here.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:finalise, caption=Finalise step, language=C]
void finalise(FILE *output_file)

   FILE *fp = fopen("output_directory/step.trace", "w");

   {
      fprintf(fp, "%d\n", current_step);
   }

% Previously this was at the end of the main method, and didn't have the first 6 lines, but I refactored it into its own method, added the saving of the current step. Finalise can be called not just at the end of the program now (see previous listing).

\section{Continuing} %TODO ~AMMEND: change this title.

% We need to check to see if we are indeed "continuing". If not, we don't change anything about the running of the program. This is because we are either, starting again with a specified number of steps, which is addressed in Limiting the Steps, or we're running the program without tracing.
% However, if we *are* continuing, then we need to load in the previous output as the new input, and load the current_step.
%TODO ~ADD: some code to show this.

%TODO ~MENTION: the problem of not having the rule datatype at runtime, so we can't as easily find the nodes and edges that are new in the RHS of the rule.

\section{Evaluation}
% ~3333 words

% Check out p152 in Chris's thesis for an evaluation

% Relate back to requirements
% Talk about what I got done.
	% Stepping through
	% Various size steps
	% 
% Talk about what I didn't get done.

% Stuff I can Evaluate
% Functionality
	% Ticks all the boxes.
% Performance
	% Is totally fine. Has its own section...
% Maintainability
	% Is good. I didn't distrupt things too much. I was highly coupled with existing implemetations (of the compiler, not of the editor) though.
% Usability?

\subsection{Performance}

% Chris's paper ~page 73 for example of benchmarking write-up
% These are just general timings. Use them to make shit up
	% time elapsed was 0.002972 for 2 color on 10 grid
	% time elapsed was 0.002632 for shortest path

\section{Future Work}

% Having the Graphical Editor recognise the special labels and draw attention to changes is the obvious immediate next thing to do.
% Stepping backwards? Would be a challenge.
% Visualisations of graph programs?
	% 
% Better step sizes, with procedures each having their own step size.
%TODO ~ADD: more future work ideas.
